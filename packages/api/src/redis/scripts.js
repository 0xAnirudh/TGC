 * Lua script loader.
 *
 * Every script declares how many of its arguments are keys on its first
 * line:
 *
 *     -- keys: 2
 *
 * That matters more than it looks. Redis Cluster routes a command by its
 * declared keys, so a script that lies about its key count works fine on
 * a single node and breaks the moment the deployment grows. Declaring it
 * in the file, next to the KEYS[] uses it describes, keeps the two from
 * drifting apart.
 *
 * Loading goes through ioredis `defineCommand`, which loads the script,
 * caches its SHA, calls EVALSHA, and transparently falls back to EVAL
 * and reloads if Redis answers NOSCRIPT - which happens after a restart
 * or a SCRIPT FLUSH. Hand-rolling that retry would be reimplementing a
 * solved problem in the one place where getting it wrong means a trade
 * fails.
