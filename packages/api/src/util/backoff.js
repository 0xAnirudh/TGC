/**
 * Exponential backoff with full jitter.
 *
 * The jitter is not decoration. Several API instances start at once on a
 * deploy, and if the store is briefly down they will all fail at the same
 * moment. Without jitter they then retry in lockstep forever, arriving as
 * a synchronised thundering herd exactly when the store is trying to
 * recover. Randomising each delay spreads them out.
 *
 * `random` is injectable so the spread can actually be tested rather than
 * assumed.
